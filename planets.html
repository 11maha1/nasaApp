                    <p class="content"> - Communication Disruption: Solar storms can interfere with satellites, GPS,
                         and radio communications.
                        - Power Grid Issues: They can cause fluctuations in electrical systems, potentially leading to power outages.
                        - Auroras: Increased geomagnetic activity produces stunning auroras in polar regions.</p>

                    <p class="content">- Atmospheric Effects: Venus has a thick atmosphere, 
                        and solar storms can enhance atmospheric escape, leading to changes in its upper atmosphere.
                        - Radiation Exposure: Increased radiation levels from solar storms 
                        may affect any potential missions or probes studying the planet..</p>

                    <h3 class="name">Mercury</h3>
                    <p class="content"> - Surface Impact: As Mercury lacks a significant atmosphere,
                         solar storms can directly impact its surface, causing changes in surface temperatures and 
                         releasing material.
                        - Magnetic Field Interaction: Solar storms can interact with Mercury’s weak magnetic field, 
                        potentially affecting its surface conditions.</p>

                    <h3 class="name">The Moon</h3>
                    <p class="content">- Radiation Exposure: Solar storms increase radiation levels in space,
                         which can impact the Moon's surface. While the Moon has no atmosphere to protect it, 
                         this exposure could be a concern for future lunar missions.
                        - Surface Changes: High-energy particles from solar storms can interact with the lunar regolith 
                        (the Moon’s surface layer), potentially altering its composition and creating secondary radiation.
                        - Electrostatic Charging: Solar storms can cause the Moon’s surface to become electrically charged,
                         which might affect dust movement and create hazardous conditions for landers and rovers </p>
